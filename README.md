Q1 reate PIN using three given input numbers
"Secure Assets Private Ltd", a small company that deal with digital lockers which can be
locked and unlocked using PINs(password). You have been asked to work on the module that is expected to generate PINs using 
three input numbers.
Assumption:  The three given input numbers will always consist of three digit i.e. each of them will be in the 
range >=100 and  <=999
100<=input1<=999
100<=input2<=999
100<=input3<=999
Below are the rules for generating the PIN-
-The PIN should be made up of 4 digits
-The unit(ones) position of the PIN should be the tens position of 
the three input numbers.
-The hundreds position of the PIN should be the least of the hundred position of the three input
numbers
the three input numbers
-The tens position of the PIN should be the least of the tens position of the three input numbers
-The hundred position of the PIN should be the least of the hundreds position of the three input numbers
-The thousand position of the PIN should be the maximum of all the digits in the three input numbers.

Example 1-
input1=123
input2=582
input3=175

then PIN 8122
Example 2-
input1=190
input2=267
input3=853

then PIN 9150 

Q2. Create a file one.txt. Write 100 to 600 each line there shoulde be one integer
Perform following operation
1. Read the content from one.txt and convert the content into intiger and reverse that number and write into two.txt
2.  Read the content from one.txt and convert the content into intiger and check palindrome number if the number is palindrome then write into three.txt
